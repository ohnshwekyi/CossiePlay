 	Login= jc336564</p>
  <h2> Goals</h2>
  <p> It is on my own opinion that cosplay is a very unique form of performance art.Thus, the goal of this web design is to get more information about the cosplay who do not really know the cosplay and they can buy some coustums in this websign and know the cosplay party as well.</p>
  <h2> Success Evaluation </h2>
  <p> In this website, there are seven main informations such as home, about as, announcement, contact, link, sign-up. For example, client can know the price of customs in announcement session and there are more about links which are related with CosPlay. Also, client can sign up to get fun the cosplay party. Therefore, client can not only get knowledgeby going other links but also get fun in the party.</p>
  <h2> Target audience</h2>
  <p> Audiences espicially younger people (between 15 to 25). No gender. Audiences who are younger generation like to watch cartoons or movies and they are also likely to do party. So, this web page was designed by colourful pictures which give attention to the client and some informations about the party.</p>
